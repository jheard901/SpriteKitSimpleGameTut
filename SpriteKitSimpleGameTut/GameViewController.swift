//creating a game based off the following tut: https://www.raywenderlich.com/119815/sprite-kit-swift-2-tutorial-for-beginners


/*
Some extra exercises you could do with this are:
 
-Add a label in the game scene to display how many monsters the player has destroyed
 OR
-Make a label that displays the remaining number of monsters the player needs to kill
-Create a menu transitioning interface from a Main Menu to the Game scene
-Create levels that are transitioned to once the player has won in a scene
-Create a life system for the player (eg 3 lives); lose 1 life each time a monster makes it to end
-Create movement system for the player character; limit it to just being vertical movement to allow different origin points for projectiles
